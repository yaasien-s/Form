# Brief
```
Please note that you can do the below tasks in any way you interpret the instructions, what we will look at is how you go about completing a simple task based on your understanding of a short brief.

Remember that we will have a look and ask some questions about your solution. You may use any resource though, but not to copy paste code please :)

The brief is simple and straightforward and shouldn't take too long to complete.

You will need some hosting space to run this web page on. If you do not have hosting space, please let me know then I can provide some space for you.
```
### Tasks
```
Build a simple form that captures name, email, valid south african phone number, and a message.
Every field is required and needs to be validated.
The page look and layout must be neat and presentable as if for a production environment.
The front-end can use whichever css/javascript framework you prefer working with.
```
### Bonus tasks
```
Use PHP(no framework or MVC) to save the data into a MySQL database.
On a page, display all user data entered into the database.
```

## Solution
```
What was built was a form with 4 different inputs(name, email, phone number +27, and message),
each field is required and is validated. I went with a warm autumn look, to increase the user experience.

I attempted the bonus task, but I was unsuccessful.
Due to my lack of knowledge on PHP I was unable to integrate PHP to Vue.js(VueX).

I tried hosting the website on Firebase but was unsuccessful due to configuration issues I was unable to figure out and find a solution.
Therefore I hosted the website on Netlify.
